# Week 13 and Onward: BrainArt 

Use [brainart_starter](https://github.com/neurotechuoft/Workshops/tree/master/beginner_2020_2021/week_13_brainart/brainart_starter) as a template for your BrainArt.
- The template is already set up to connect to the Muse headsetâ€”it's your job to code for EEG interpretation and visualization.
- **How should EEG be interpreted and visualized? That's up to you!** You could have signals from the 4 electrodes graphed in real time, you could have signals of different frequencies graphed in real time (e.g. alpha, beta, etc.), you could create a display where electrodes/regions light up with a certain frequency of activation (as in the [brainart](https://github.com/neurotechuoft/Workshops/tree/master/beginner_2020_2021/brainart) example), and so on
- **How do you process EEG?** Review the notebooks from [Week 4](https://github.com/neurotechuoft/workshops/tree/master/beginner_2020_2021/week_4_loading_graphing_data) & [Week 5](https://github.com/neurotechuoft/workshops/tree/master/beginner_2020_2021/week_5_noise_filtering), and the lecture from [Weeks 10-11](https://github.com/neurotechuoft/workshops/tree/master/beginner_2020_2021/week_10_dsp1)
- **How do you interpret EEG?** Review the lecture from [Week 12](https://github.com/neurotechuoft/workshops/tree/master/beginner_2020_2021/week_12_eeg)
- **Struggling with Angular and/or Typescript?** Review the tutorials from [Week 7](https://github.com/neurotechuoft/workshops/tree/master/beginner_2020_2021/week_7_angular)
